# NN-Bayes
Scripts for our NN-Bayes paper:
*Tianjing Zhao, Rohan L. Fernando, and Hao Cheng. "Interpretable Artificial Neural Networks incorporating Bayesian Alphabet Models for Genome-wide Prediction and Association Studies." bioRxiv (2021).* [see here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.07.438762v1?rss=1)


To perform NN-Bayes in [JWAS](https://github.com/reworkhow/JWAS.jl/tree/master/src/1.JWAS/src), please see latest examples [here]([https://github.com/reworkhow/JWAS.jl/wiki/Neural-Networks](https://github.com/reworkhow/JWAS.jl/wiki/Neural-Networks-(NN-LMM))). More details can be found in the documentation of JWAS. The scripts here may be invalid due to the updated NN-Bayes interface in JWAS.
